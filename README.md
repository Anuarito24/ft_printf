# ft_printf
The versatility of the C printf function is a great programming exercise for us. This will allow you to discover variadic functions in C in a particularly relevant context, as well as learn about a great example of a basic "dispatcher" in C using an array of function pointers.
The key to ft_printf's success is well structured and well extensible code.
